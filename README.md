# ‚ùì Operation Curiosity, a Full Stack project developed as a study 
Operation Curisodiade allows you to learn more about a person.

<ul> <b>Things you can do in this project: </b>
  <li> Login with the users that already exist; </li>
  <li> A complete CRUD: get (getAll, GetUser, SearchUser), create (AddUser), update (Updateuser) and delete an user (DeleteUser); </li>
  <li> View your profile. </li>
</ul>
<br>

## üëæ "How do I use this?" 
<ul>
  <li> You must have the <b>.NET Framework</b> downloaded in your machine; </li>
  <li> Clone this repository so you have it on your machine; </li>
  <li> In your File Explorer, open the project folder where it was downloaded; </li>
  <li> Inside the full-stack-project, click on the "ForLogic.Treinamento.OperacaoCuriosidade" folder and then click on the executable file (you need to have .NET installed); </li>
  <li> In .NET, download the packages that are used in NuGet packages; </li>
  <li> Click the play button to start the project in .NET. This will run the API; </li>
  <li> Pay attention to the url, which has "locahost:number" at the beginning of it. (You can test just the API in this step if you want);</li>
  <li> After you tested and copied the "localhost:number", you can open the "HttpClient" folder in a code editor (I recommend Visual Studio Code); </li>
  <li> Inside the Http Client folder opened in VS Code, go to the services folder and click on the "Services.js" file; </li>
  <li> Now that you are inside the Services.js, change this line with the "localhost:number" that you saw running in the API: 
  ``` const PORT = 'localhost:7054'; ```
  </li>
  <li> After this, you can click, inside the VS Code, in the "login" folder. There, you will find the "login.html" file. Run this file in your browser; </li>
  <li> In the "ForLogic.Treinamento.OperacaoCuriosidade" folder, you will find the "InitialScript" which was used for reunning the Sql Server in this project. Take the email and password (Columns "Email" and "Senha") from an user;</li>
  <li> Use these credentials in the login.html while the API is running. With this, you already can use all the available features! </li>
  
</ul>
